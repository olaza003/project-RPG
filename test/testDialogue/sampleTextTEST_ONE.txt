Fire is the rapid oxidation of a
material in the exothermic
chemical process of combustion,
releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.

Fire is hot because
the conversion of
the weak double bond in molecular oxygen,
O2, to the stronger bonds in
the combustion products carbon
dioxide and water releases energy (418 kJ per 32 g of O2);
[SEQ_THREE] 2 3 2 1 1
the bond energies of the
fuel play only a minor role here.
At a certain point in the combustion
reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced.
The flame is the visible portion of the fire. Flames consist
primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen.
If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma.
Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside,
the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.

Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration,

which has the potential to cause physical damage

through burning.

Fire is an important process

that affects ecological systems around the globe.

The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining

various ecological systems. Its negative effects

include hazard to life and property,
atmospheric pollution, and water contamination.
If fire removes protective vegetation,

heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water.
[SEQ_FIVE]
Also, when vegetation is burned,
the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere,
unlike elements such as potassium
and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil.

This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces
a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil,
[SEQ_SIX]
but this fecundity can potentially be recovered as

molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere is "fixed" and

converted to ammonia by natural phenomena such as lightning

and by leguminous plants that are "nitrogen-fixing"


such as clover, peas, and green beans.

Fire has been used by humans in rituals,
in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light,
for signaling, propulsion purposes,
smelting, forging, incineration of waste, cremation,
and as a weapon or mode of destruction.
