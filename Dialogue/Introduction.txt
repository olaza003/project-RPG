A voice speaks to you.
"A letter came in today. 'U R G E N T' written on it in big, bold, red letters. It's another search request. This makes it the fifth one today.
We need you to take this one since we can't afford to refuse. Royal Orders, y'know? Especially since we need the funding.
We're short staffed having everyone else deal with the other requests so you are going to have to go alone for this one.
We'll let you have a few items we have left in the back, but that's the best we can do. You're going to have to make due with what you have on you.

Now I know how everyone thinks this is a waste of time, but I need you to fill out this form. Standard procedure 'n all.

So can you give me your name?"
"And your class type?"
"Great. Phenomenal. Now here's a list of a items you can take. Sadly, we can literally only afford to give you two so choose wisely."
"I'll read it back to you just to make sure that everything's correct. Just tell me if there's anything that should be fixed."
