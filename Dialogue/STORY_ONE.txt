DUNGEON CRAWLER(TM)
[INTRODUCTION] 9 1 1 1
A voice speaks to you.
"A letter came in today. 'U R G E N T' written on it in big, bold, red letters. It's another search request. This makes it the fifth one today.
We need you to take this one since we can't afford to refuse. Royal Orders, y'know? Especially since we need the funding.
We're short staffed having everyone else deal with the other requests so you are going to have to go alone for this one.
We'll let you have a few items we have left in the back, but that's the best we can do. You're going to have to make due with what you have on you.

Now I know how everyone thinks this is a waste of time, but I need you to fill out this form. Standard procedure 'n all.

So can you give me your name?"
"And your class type?"
"Great. Phenomenal. Now here's a list of a items you can take. Sadly, we can literally only afford to give you two so choose wisely."
"I'll read it back to you just to make sure that everything's correct. Just tell me if there's anything that should be fixed."

The request included a rather vague set of directions, but it was enough to get where you needed to go.
This time, the location is a dungeon. Not the first time a search request has sent you here so it probably won't take long, you hope.

The entrance is located deep within a dense forest; rays of sunlight beaming through the trees. The wind passes through - softly rustling the leaves.
A calm feeling flows through you.

You walk inside, and immediantly, that calm feeling is flushed, and instead, you are on high alert. You are now at the mercy of the dungeon.

You look around and see no signs that suggest that anyone was near by. There are lit torches on the wall, but it seems that 
these belong to the dungeon. That means that the missing person must be deeper inside.

There is only one passage forward so you take that path. Unlike the fresh air outside, the air here was rancid and awful.

Walking further down the passage, you hear growls and footsteps ahead. A werewolf -rotten and disfigured- blocks your path.
You can not run away, and it has already seen you. You are left to fight it.

The monster is slain, and you continue further down the passage.
